🐟 Multiclass Fish Image Classification
📌 Project Overview
This project classifies fish images into multiple species using Deep Learning. It leverages both a custom CNN and transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNetB0). The final model is deployed as a Streamlit web app, allowing users to upload an image and get a real-time prediction with confidence scores.

💡 Problem Statement
The goal is to accurately classify fish images into their respective species. The challenge includes building models from scratch, fine-tuning pre-trained models, and deploying a user-friendly application for real-time predictions.

📈 Business Use Cases
Fisheries & Aquaculture: Automate fish species identification for monitoring and sorting.

Marine Research: Support biodiversity tracking and conservation efforts.

Commercial Applications: Improve quality control in seafood industries.

🔍 Approach
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Augmentation
Rescale images to the [0, 1] range.

Apply augmentation: rotation, zoom, flipping, shifting.

2️⃣ Model Training
Train a CNN from scratch.

Fine-tune five pre-trained models.

Save the best model in .keras format for deployment.

3️⃣ Model Evaluation
Compare accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Plot training history and confusion matrices.

4️⃣ Deployment (Streamlit App)
Upload fish image.

Predict species with confidence scores for all classes.

📂 Dataset
Images organized in folders by species.

Loaded via ImageDataGenerator in TensorFlow.

Provided as a ZIP file in the dataset folder.
